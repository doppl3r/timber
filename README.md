Timber
=========

Timber is a super cool texture changing software built on top of Canvas. It's super small and doesn't rely on jQuery.


Installation
--------------
This part is simple, just include your script
```sh
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/timber.js"></script>
```
After that, just pop in your id for any element
```sh
<div id="timber"></div>
```
You are now ready to have a fully-functional, highly responsive slider tool! Enjoy!

Customize
--------------
Want to change the background? POW! That easy!
```sh
image directory: "img/timber-assets/<yourimage.jpg>"
```
```sh
<script>
	timber.setBackground("natural.jpg");
</script>
```
