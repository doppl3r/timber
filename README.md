TimberBlender
=========

TimberBlender is a super cool texture changing software built on top of Canvas. It's super small and doesn't rely on jQuery.


Installation
--------------
This part is simple, just include your script
```sh
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/timberblender.js"></script>
```
After that, just pop in your id for any element
```sh
<div id="timber"></div>
```
You are now ready to have a fully-functional, highly responsive slider tool! Enjoy!
